##"Featherweight Web Development with Node.js"
Does your framework ever feel like a straitjacket? Would you rather trade it in for a cape made of pheonix down? Come hear how Crunch Magic used Node.js and Redis to build an online game and a state of the art recommender system that help you find games you'll love.

## About our Speaker

### Waylon Flynn


Waylon started out in a town with not so much as a calculus class anywhere in a 50 mile radius and began teaching himself to program when he was 11. He eventually got degrees in Physics and Math and wrote the software they use to test astronauts on the International Space Station. The first game he ever loved was Final Fantasy on the NES. Now he thinks games are the future of the world and he's dedicated his life to making life more fun.
